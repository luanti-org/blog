## What is the Luanti blog?

We post updates about once per month (subject to change) to let you know what's
new with Luanti. We cover everything about Luanti, from engine development,
to mod and game progress, to server news and community events. Even
Luanti-related artwork has a place here. Posts are subdivided by general
topic.

We can also do special posts about important events or updates important to the
general Luanti community.
