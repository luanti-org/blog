# Welcome to the Minetest Blog!

We post updates about once per month (subject to change) to let you know what's
new with Minetest. We cover everything about Minetest, from engine development,
to mod and game progress, to server news and community events. Even
Minetest-related artwork has a place here. Posts are subdivided by general
topic.

We can also do special posts about important events or updates important to the
general Minetest community.
