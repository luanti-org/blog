## Engine News <a name="engine"></a>

Engine development slowed significantly immediately after the 5.6.0 release. (It has gotten back on track since then.) The 5.6 release broke the android port, but 5.6.1 should be released soon to fix this and other issues.

### Multidecor

[Multidecor](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Andrey01/multidecor/) by [Andrey01](https://content.minetest.net/users/Andrey01/) brings a bit of realism to your world with home furnishings from several different time periods.

### Direction Compass

[Direction Compass](https://content.minetest.net/packages/apercy/direction_compass/) is a new compass mod by [Apercy](https://content.minetest.net/users/apercy/). Its intent is to avoid confusion caused by the misleading yaw value in the builtin debug screen. Having the compass in your inventory puts an HUD on the screen of your position. Then having the compass selected also adds a live-updating compass HUD.

### BeTween Api

Perhaps the most exciting mod released this month, [BeTween Api](https://content.minetest.net/packages/_gianpy_/api_between/) by [Gianpy](https://content.minetest.net/users/_gianpy_/)
https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=28545 is a new interpolation api which can be used for smoothly animating HUD elements, as well as anything else that needs smooth interpolation using a collection of available rules. You can choose from linear, sinusoidal, circular, quartic, quadratic and elastic interpolation methods. Here is a demo of it in action:
