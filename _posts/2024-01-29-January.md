## Engine News

### New Core Developer

The community welcomes longtime community member Lars Müller (aka Luatic, appguru(eu), LMD) ([Github](https://github.com/appgurueu),
[ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/users/LMD/)), as the newest Core Developer! He has made
[many contributions](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/commits?author=appgurueu) to documentation and entities, is
currently assisting the effort to [introduce the modern glTF model format](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/14234),
and is working on [a PR to allow specific entities to be hidden from players](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/13987).

### Improved Touchscreen Support

With SDL2 recently being set as the [default rendering backend](https://github.com/minetest/irrlicht/pull/209),
progress on better integration of gamepads and touchscreens can easily move forward.
[Grorp's PR](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/14146) to enable mouse and touchscreen input on any device paired
with [work by okias](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/14075) to switch between the two while playing marks
another great step towards universal input support.

### Entity Animation Improvements

Lars M. has [extended the capabilities of armature bones](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/12388), allowing
mods to set individual bone position, rotation, and scale, with optional relation to defined animations and
interpolation over time. This will finally allow game developers and modders to implement smoother entity animations in Lua.

### God Rays Shader

x2048's [god rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular_rays) shader was
[adopted by lhofhansl](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/13881) and merged into the development version of
Minetest 5.9.0. Similar to dynamic shadows, game developers can choose to enable
[the new lighting API features](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/40bf88ac7483084c3ba9b77004c36c6f62ed05ca/doc/lua_api.md?plain=1#L8086)
to allow god rays in their games. Players must enable both bloom and volumetric lighting in their settings to utilize
the new shader.

### Touchscreen Tap Inputs

Many items are used by holding the place button (right mouse by default), such as
bows and shields from MineClone2. Until [PR #14087 by grorp](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/14087), these
items did not work on touchscreens. With the PR merged, game and mod developers can determine which action a given item
performs on a long or short tap. The PR also changes the default touchscreen punch behavior to a short tap, improving
the Minetest combat experience and bringing it closer to other mobile voxel games.


## 2023 Game Jam Winners

[The 2023 Game Jam](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=29957) was held in December with the theme "Unexpected".
Contestants were given three weeks to make games from scratch and submit them to ContentDB. After the community ranked
their favorite submissions on the new [Game Jam Site](https://jam.minetest.net), the winners emerged.

### 1st Place: Citadel by Irevol

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2024_TopOfYear/Citadel.png" caption='The Ruins of the Citadel' %}

Weave through the past and future in the 4-dimensional parkour puzzle game
[Citadel](https://content.minetest.net/packages/_Irevol_/citadel/) by [Irevol](https://content.minetest.net/users/_Irevol_/).
You are a daring explorer searching the ruins of an ancient citadel. You find mysterious runes which allow you to
navigate space and time and unearth the secrets and treasures of the Citadel.

### 2nd Place: The Velvet Crystal by Regulus

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2024_TopOfYear/velvet_crystal.png" caption='The mission begins' %}

Recover the lost crystal and bring light back to the world in [The Velvet
Crystal](https://content.minetest.net/packages/regulus/regulus_mtgamejam_2023/) by [Regulus](https://content.minetest.net/users/regulus/),
a parkour game with a twist. Use your wand to perform stunts and help you navigate the castle. Gather information from
voiced NPCs and defeat the final boss to recover the velvet crystal.

### 3rd place: The Unexpected Gambit by NO11

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2024_TopOfYear/gambit.png" caption='Your Move' %}

Are you a chess lover? [The Unexpected Gambit](https://content.minetest.net/packages/NO11/the_unexpected_gambit/) by [NO11](https://content.minetest.net/users/NO11/) will keep you on your toes with crazy moves that come at unexpected moments. Experience a very polished implementation of
a classic game with interesting twists in The Unexpected Gambit.

### Honorable Mentions

Thank you to everyone who participated in the game jam and congratulations to the winners! We hope all the participants
continue to improve their games to become polished player experiences and great showcases of what Minetest can do.
Here are some other interesting projects that emerged from the 2023 jam.

#### MineOS

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2024_TopOfYear/mineos.png" caption='It can even run Boom!' %}

[MineOS](https://content.minetest.net/packages/jordan4ibanez/mineos/) by [jordan4ibanez](https://content.minetest.net/users/jordan4ibanez/)
is an astonishing demo, especially for those familiar with Minetest's GUI capabilities. MineOS implements a polished
graphical operating system with retro sound effects and animations and includes several windowed apps to play with,
including a 3D [DOOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(franchise))-like shooter. It was certainly unexpected.

#### Shadow Forest

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2024_TopOfYear/shadowForest.png" caption='The shadows are coming!' %}

[Shadow Forest](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/shadow_forest/) by [Wuzzy](https://content.minetest.net/users/Wuzzy/)
is a polished role-playing game where you fill the shoes of the Wizard of Light (and his trusty Light Crystal companion).
Your quest is to rid the forest of the invading Shadows. Collect resources, level up your skills, and use your Staff of
Light to defeat the Shadows. Read more about [the making of Shadow Forest on Wuzzy's website!](https://wuzzy.codeberg.page/games/makingof_shadow_forest/)

## Mods News

### Vehicles from Apercy

{% include figure_gallery.html items=page.gallery_apercy %}

[APercy](https://content.minetest.net/users/apercy/) has continued creating
lots more quality vehicle mods since the last post, including a VW bug addition
to [Automobiles Pack](https://content.minetest.net/packages/apercy/automobiles_pck/),

### TypeScript For Minetest

[jordan4ibanez](https://content.minetest.net/users/jordan4ibanez/) has created a
[TypeScript modding system]() on top of the Lua API using the TypeScriptToLua
compiler. He made a custom TypeScript typing system specifically for Minetest
and is using it in his project
[ForgottenLands](https://github.com/jordan4ibanez/forgotten-lands).

### BlockExchange

{% include figure_gallery.html items=page.gallery_BlEx %}

The [Blockexchange project](https://content.minetest.net/packages/BuckarooBanzay/blockexchange/) by [BuckarooBanzay](https://content.minetest.net/users/BuckarooBanzay/) has undergone internal rewrites and
enhancements that improve the overall usability, such as logging in with
ContentDB, featured schematics on the homepage, better schematic detail pages
with CDB collections and markdown support, and a new UI with faster response
times. Check out the new features here: <https://blockexchange.minetest.ch/>

## Other News

### Minetest at Events in December

In late 2023, Minetest was featured at several conventions around Italy thanks
to Zughy and his sponsor Italian Linux Society. Zughy has brought Minetest to
several events in Northern and Central Italy from underground videogame
festivals like [Zona Warpa](https://www.zonawarpa.it/) to Free software events like [MERGE-it](https://merge-it.net/). He demoed games
and gave talks (you can listen to one of them [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBZoPYleoX4), in spaghetti language 🍝 ). In
December, Zughy also presented a workshop at Empoli for the first time, where
participants learned how to create a complete minigame from scratch using
[arena_lib](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Zughy/arena_lib/). It doesn't seem like these events are going to stop. What's next?
FOSDEM!

## FOSDEM 2024

Minetest will be at FOSDEM 2024. FOSDEM is the largest conference in Europe for
free and open-source software and will be held from 3rd to 4th February in
Brussels, Belgium. We'll be running a booth, showing off Minetest, giving out
stickers and goodies, and introducing visitors to the Minetest!

If you happen to be in the area, come say hi!
