Highlights include a **content browser redesign**,
support for the modern **glTF** model file format,
support for gettext translation file formats, new visual effects,
an API for "per-player" objects, usability improvements, and much more.

## Content Browser Redesign

Luanti's built-in content browser was redesigned to be more user-friendly and appealing,
presenting "content" (mods, games or texture packs) in a grid. See for yourself:

You can now also view the details for a package, similar to the ContentDB web interface:

## glTF Support

In the past, Luanti mod developers had to choose between two antiquated file formats
for animated 3d models (`.b3d` and `.x`), which are hard to work with using modern software.

Luanti now supports the modern [glTF file format](https://www.khronos.org/glTF/),
which allows for seamless exports directly from modeling software such as Blender or Blockbench.
It also allows mod developers to simply grab freely licensed assets of the internet already in glTF format.

Support is still a bit rough around the edges,
but feature parity with the other model file formats has already been achieved,
and better support is planned in the future.

## Gettext Translation File Support

Luanti modders have historically had to use Luanti's own `.tr` translation file format,
which complicated managing translations via external tools such as Weblate.
Now, Luanti supports the standard [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) `.po` and `.mo` translation file formats.
A handy bonus feature is that translations can now easily use the correct plural forms.

## Visual Effects

Luanti now has even more eye candy for players to enjoy! Among the list of improvements are
simple liquid reflections and waves, translucent foliage, node specular highlights, softer clouds and tinted shadows.
The cover image is featuring these effects.

## Per-player Objects

Mod developers can now fully control which players each object gets sent to.
For example, the [Capture The Flag](https://content.luanti.org/packages/rubenwardy/capturetheflag/)
server uses this to have nametags which can only be seen by teammates.
It also enables modders to implement per-player in-world interfaces or displays.

As the implementation is purely serverside, a 5.10.0 Luanti server suffices.
Server owners wishing to take advantage of this feature need not nag their clients to upgrade.

## More Highlights

* **"IPC"**: Async environments can now share data freely via a key-value store that is shared among all environments,
  including the main server environment, making async environments much more powerful.
  Basic synchronization primitives are provided for modders to build their abstractions on.
* **Bulk LBMs** let you run loading block modifiers on entire mapblocks "in bulk".
* The API now exposes **joystick direction** (as X and Y axes).
  This is especially interesting for player-controlled vehicles or arcade-inspired games.
* There have been some **usability** improvements:
  * Android: The button bar has been replaced with a grid menu for easier access
  * GUI scaling has been improved, particularly for mobile users
  * Server & content list search now require all keywords to match
  * A setting to disable smooth scrolling has been added

## Conclusion

This is just a summary of selected features.
As per usual, there have been many more minor features and bugfixes.
