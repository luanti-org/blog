## Engine News <a name="engine"></a>

### Last Month's Development

June saw 46 commits to master, 38 PRs merged, and 92 issues closed.

Continuing with User Experience improvements, rubenwardy has been working on a
settings redesign. The intention is to make settings more discoverable and
easier to change. Zughy provided the new icons, and along with Giova, the
settings structure.

This is the start of the mainmenu redesign project. The styling matches the
current mainmenu style, but it will change when the mainmenu redesign is worked
on.

### Upcoming Development

rubenwardy plans to continue working on the settings redesign. It needs to go
through review, and then the next step is to only show settings if they are
relevant. For example, shader settings should only be visible when shaders are
enabled, and Android settings should only be on Android.

Work on the rest of the mainmenu redesign is likely to start at some point in
the next few months.

x2048 has been working on adding post-processing to Minetest. This is part
of the graphics modernization project, and will result in improved performance
for tone mapping. It will also allow new effects including depth of field, bloom,
and color filters to be implemented.

Minetest 5.6.0 is currently planned for July. Releases are preceeded by a
feature freeze, a period of time where only bug fixes and maintenance changes
are allowed. Freezes last for at least one week, and are extended if there are
remaining issues.

### Traitor

Traitor has recently received two long requested features, vents and level sabotage. The vents have been adapted from Joe7575's hyperloop mod and allow for traitors and ghosts to instantly travel from vent to vent on levels, if the level builders add them of course. This feature has been requested for over a year. Level sabotage, while slightly buggy, is available. Currently there is only one node that can be sabotaged by the traitor, the switch. Level designers can choose how long the players have to repair the sabotaged node, and if repairing, or failing to repair, the node should result in the match ending.

### Exile

[Exile's](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Mantar/exile/) tech tree was rebalanced to provide for multiple paths. A new mapgen feature has been added that spawn giant rings on the surface, probably left by the Ancients.
You can now throw spears for hunting and fighting. Canoes and airboats have been improved for performance. Tree trunks and some other things are more fire resistant now.
Fish farming is now possible with an update to the Gundu fish's behavior, and finally, the spanish translation of the game has been completed.

### Colour Jump

[MrFreeman's](https://content.minetest.net/users/MrFreeman/) first mod is a minigame called [Colour Jump](https://content.minetest.net/packages/MrFreeman/colour_jump/). Its all about jumping on the correct platform before you get eliminated.

### pilzmod

[Phii](https://content.minetest.net/users/Phii/) has released ["pilzmod"](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Phii/pilzmod/), an interesting new biome mod. It adds an unnatural mushroom biome that must be spawned to appear. After that, it grows on its own accord, and can only be contained by defeating the boss that will spawn in it.
