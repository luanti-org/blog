### Last Month's Development

June saw 46 commits to master, 38 PRs merged, and 92 issues closed.

Continuing with User Experience improvements, rubenwardy has been working on a
settings redesign. The intention is to make settings more discoverable and
easier to change. Zughy provided the new icons, and along with Giova, the
settings structure.

This is the start of the mainmenu redesign project. The styling matches the
current mainmenu style, but it will change when the mainmenu redesign is worked
on.

### Upcoming Development

rubenwardy plans to continue working on the settings redesign. It needs to go
through review, and then the next step is to only show settings if they are
relevant. For example, shader settings should only be visible when shaders are
enabled, and Android settings should only be on Android.

Work on the rest of the mainmenu redesign is likely to start at some point in
the next few months.

x2048 has been working on adding post-processing to Minetest. This is part
of the graphics modernization project, and will result in improved performance
for tone mapping. It will also allow new effects including depth of field, bloom,
and color filters to be implemented.

Minetest 5.6.0 is currently planned for July. Releases are preceeded by a
feature freeze, a period of time where only bug fixes and maintenance changes
are allowed. Freezes last for at least one week, and are extended if there are
remaining issues.
