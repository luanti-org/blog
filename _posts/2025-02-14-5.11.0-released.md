<h2 class="sr-only">Introduction</h2>

Luanti 5.11.0 is landing right on time following our 3-month release schedule! Many new menu features have arrived alongside font overrides, continued model improvements, rendering fixes, and more.

You can download Luanti from [our website](https://www.luanti.org/downloads/), check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/), or read the [full changelog](https://docs.luanti.org/changelog/#5100--5110).

## Compatibility Changes

There are a few changes which may (or may not) affect you, so we'll get them out of the way first:

* **OpenGL 2.0** is now the minimum OpenGL version required by Luanti ([here's why](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/15370)).
* BMP image support has been dropped as it was deprecated in 2023 due to extremely rare use.
* A long-standing bug with bone rotations was fixed, which [may break some mods](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/15692) that had worked around the issue. In particular, mods overriding bones with 180° rotations (like [playeranim](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Rui/playeranim/)) may have issues until fixed. Check your mods, devs!

## In-Game Settings Menu

The settings menu can now be accessed from the in-game pause menu (very convenient!). Keep in mind that not every setting supports live changes, so you may still need to reconnect after making certain alterations.

## Touchscreen Layout Editor

For those of you on smartphones or some other touchscreen device ([smartwatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MItj9AJbP4), anybody?), Luanti now includes a layout editor for your on-screen controls. Select `Touchscreen Layout` in the pause menu and organize the buttons to your heart's content!

## More Server List Info

Have you ever wanted to check server info _before_ you connect? Until now we had to use the [online server list](https://servers.luanti.org/), but Luanti has introduced 4 new buttons allowing you to open the server's website, view its mod list, see which players are online, and manage your favorites. You can also filter your searches by game, mod, or player (see search bar tooltip for specifics).

## Default Font Overrides

Luanti's fonts are starting to get boring after more than a decade, so mods can now override the defaults! Place TTF or WOFF fonts in your mod's `fonts` directory for each style you want to override (check out [the documentation](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/blob/5.11.0/doc/lua_api.md#custom-fonts) for more details). This is just the first step towards better font control, so keep an eye out for future font features.

## Other Highlights

* **Clients' `version_string` is now available** in `core.get_player_information()`, with `core.protocol_versions` added to verify available client features ([#15708](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15708)).
* **glTF STEP interpolation** is now supported ([#15525](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15525)).
* The chat console has a scrollbar now ([#15104](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15104)).
* Some unwanted disconnects have been eliminated ([#15680](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15680)).
* Various rendering issues (shadow flicker, overlay Z-fighting, MSAA/bloom artifacts, orbit tilt distortions, and more) have been fixed.

## Onwards and Upwards

Development continues with 5.12.0, now at [github.com/luanti-org/luanti](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti)! You can likely look forward to [more visual effects](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15417), [unique entity IDs](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/14135), [collision improvements](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15408), [better pause menu settings](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/15701), and [more](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/milestone/26).
