### Asuna

{% include figure_gallery.html items=page.asuna %}

[Asuna](https://content.minetest.net/packages/EmptyStar/asuna/) by
[EmptyStar](https://content.minetest.net/users/EmptyStar/) welcomes the
otherworldly wonders of the
[Everness](https://content.minetest.net/packages/SaKeL/everness/) mod to its
domain! From the sparkling vistas of the crystal forests to the haunted bogs of
the cursed lands, down to the depths of its lush caves, icy caverns, and beyond—
Everness is now a crown jewel of the Asuna experience. With a few personal
touches and careful integration into Asuna's fantastic fabric of biomes,
Everness graces every corner of the world.

Along with the inclusion of Everness, much work has been done to improve
Asuna's underground, new biomes have been added, and landscapes are now more
diverse than ever. Join the new [Asuna Discord
server](https://discord.gg/DqtD9kuk2R) to stay up-to-date with Asuna's
development.

### BlockColor

In an effort to preserve an old, interesting game project, the
[mt-historical](https://github.com/mt-historical) organization has added
[BlockColor by
MrChiantos](https://content.minetest.net/packages/mt-mods/blockcolor/) to
ContentDB. The name says it all: It's a world of blocks painted with a soothing
palette of colors.

## Mods News

### Mail

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2023_MayJune/mailmod.png" caption="New
    Mail Features" %}

Many servers rely on the [Mail
mod](https://content.minetest.net/packages/mt-mods/mail/) for in-game
communication. Since the beginning of the year, the
[mt-mods](https://github.com/mt-mods) organization has developed many new
features and fixed several bugs using feedback from the [YourLand
server](https://your-land.de/). They also added translations for at least 6 new
languages. The biggest new addition is the "Sent Messages" folder, which
required a complete rewrite of the storage system (thanks to BuckarooBanzay).

Other new features include mailing lists, sorters and filters, drafts,
multiple-message selection, and a new "About" page.

Most recently, the [1.2.0
release](https://github.com/mt-mods/mail/releases/tag/1.2.0) has brought
settings, a trash system, major performance improvements, and bug fixes.

Contributors to the mail mod include S-S-X, BuckarooBanzay, fluxionary, and the
YourLand server.

### Minestory

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2023_MayJune/minestory.png"
    caption="Students recreating the Lascaux cave in Minetest during Minestory"
    %}

Every year, hundreds of students from schools across France participate in
[Minestory](http://minetest.wp.ac-dijon.fr/minestory-frise-immersive-de-sites-du-patrimoine-architectural/),
an event created by French teacher Julien Crémoux in 2019. Students are tasked
to replicate a heritage site from their local area such as Notre-Dame or the
Louvre castle on a Minetest server, and then give a virtual tour of their
creation. The event is also an opportunity for students to provide feedback and
ideas regarding educational projects.

This year's Minestory event was hosted in Terrasson-Lavilledieu in France on May
31st, 2023. 150 of the 413 participants visited the nearby [Lascaux
cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux), which is known for its prehistoric
cave paintings. The next day, Thomate, Riwad, and Lemente organised a 10-minute
workshop (one of 14 other workshops) in which students decorated a Minetest cave
with simple cave paintings using the
[ggraffiti](https://content.minetest.net/packages/grorp/ggraffiti/) and
[cave_painting](https://github.com/Lemente/cave_painting) mods. The students
were challenged to draw one of the animals they saw depicted the previous day.

Open Survival team removed several mods and completely reset the world and the
players.
