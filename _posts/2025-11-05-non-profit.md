<h2 class="sr-only">Introduction</h2>

Luanti has joined Open Collective Europe (OCE), a non-profit based in Belgium
that provides fiscal hosting to open source projects. Other OCE projects include
EndeavourOS, F-Droid, and postmarketOS. This unlocks new opportunities for us.

## Why Open Collective Europe?

It's been a goal to set Luanti up as a non-profit organization for a while.
However, setting up a new non-profit entity is quite expensive in both time and
money. Open Collective Europe is a non-profit fiscal host, which allows us to
raise money like a non-profit but without the overhead of managing a full
non-profit organization ourselves. If we later decide to set up a full
non-profit organization then we will be able to transfer any balance from Open
Collective Europe to the new organization.

We went with Open Collective Europe because it is well-respected and based in
Europe. Open Collective Europe also uses the Open Collective platform for
fundraising and expenses, which provides a high level of transparency.

Open Collective Europe is equivalent to a US 501(c)3 non-profit. This means that
it is a charity for public benefit and we can receive grants from US
foundations. Donations to Luanti from US-based individuals and foundations may
be tax-deductible.


## How has Luanti been funded in the past?

We pay for server hosting to host essential services for Luanti, including the
server list, ContentDB, and the forums. In the past, these services have been
paid for by the staff member responsible, with some staff members accepting
donations to cover their costs.

Luanti had a stand at FOSDEM in 2024 and 2025. Attending FOSDEM costs us roughly
€3000 each year. This includes merchandise, promotional materials, travel, and
accommodation. Some of this money was raised by rubenwardy via private support,
the rest was from other non-profit organisations
([Institut de Recherche et d'Innovation](https://www.iri.centrepompidou.fr/?lang=en_us),
[Italian Linux Society](https://www.ils.org/),
and [Wikimedia Italy](https://www.wikimedia.it/)) agreeing to pay expenses.
Joining OCE takes the burden off individuals to fundraise and cover costs.


## What are our plans for the future?

### Promoting Luanti and bringing the community together

We're hoping to return to FOSDEM with a stand in 2026. We'd also like to arrange
a small Luanti meetup on the Saturday of FOSDEM.

We may also use donations to fund local meetups, hackathons, and other
conferences.

### Supporting development

Open Collective Europe allows paying people on a freelancer basis. In the
long-term, we'd love to have a developer working on Luanti full-time one day. In
the short-term, we may pay for a UI/UX designer and a user researcher to work on
our main menu.

### Non-profit grants

Joining a non-profit allows us to apply for certain grants available for open
source software. This could be used to develop new functionality.

### Transparency and community involvement

We welcome community involvement with the new collective. If you have any
thoughts or ideas, feel free to share them.

The Open Collective platform makes all contributions and expenses public. We'll
also post a yearly update summarizing our finances.

We’re currently in the process of creating governance and expenditure polices.
If you have experience with this or know of projects that do this well, we would
welcome your input.

## How much of my donation goes to Luanti?

From the [Open Collective Europe docs](https://docs.opencollective.com/oceurope/faq/general-faqs#how-much-does-it-cost):

> Open Collective Europe charges a standard **administrative fee**:
>
> - **8%** for most contributions (plus card processing fees)
>     - 1.5% + €0.25 for European cards
>     - 2.5% + €0.25 for non-European cards
> - **10%** if your Collective:
>     - Receives a **grant or sponsorship**
>     - Receives a **tax-deductible donation**
>     - Receives a **public subsidy**
>     - Receives a **manual bank transfer**

The administration fees go to the Open Collective Europe foundation to cover
their overheads. Part of the fees go to the Open Collective platform.

We would likely lose more than 10% if we were to set up our own non-profit
organization, so we believe this is fair.
