## Engine News <a name="engine"></a>
	Minetest 5.5.1 was released this month. It fixes a whole list of bugs ( see [here](https://dev.minetest.net/Changelog#5.5.0_.E2.86.92_5.5.1) ). x2048 worked on improving rendering. Now, snow and other simple nodeboxes do not draw hidden faces. Of course, this only applies to opaque nodes.  Also, x2048 improved soft shadows.

### Nodecore
	Since March, Warr1024 has been working on translations for Nodecore. Now there are practically complete translations in Russian, French, and German.
	Also, many things have been improved with the optics automation systems. The new features especially improve optics' detection capabilities.
	
### Exile
	Exile 0.3.7 is out! Among other improvements, the highlights are: improved airboats, multiplayer node protection for some valuable items, and the beginnings of translation support.
	
### Cascade

	Cascade is a new maze game. While other maze games have been released, this one is unique in that each new maze level is laid out before you before you enter it, giving you a chance to plan your route to the exit. Once entered, the walls are too high to see over. It is an interesting take on the maze game theme.

### Xmaps

[xmaps](https://content.minetest.net/packages/erlehmann/xmaps/) is a new mod by [erle](https://content.minetest.net/users/erlehmann/) that adds treasure-maps to the HUD. You get them by rightclicking a mapping kit. You can mark the spot with an X by rightclicking a node. Treasure Hunt, anyone?

### Steampunk Blimp
{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2022_May/blimp_1.jpg" caption="Exploring the Skies" %}

[Apercy's](https://content.minetest.net/users/apercy/) [Airship](https://content.minetest.net/packages/apercy/steampunk_blimp/) is Minetest's first vehicle that you can walk on while it flies. It aims for a sense of immersion, with a fire and steamengine sound, and being able to refill the watertank by landing on water. It brings a sense of adventure and mystique to any game as you fly off into the distance with a couple freinds. 
 
### Texture Generator
[LMD's](https://content.minetest.net/users/LMD/) new [texture generator mod](https://content.minetest.net/packages/LMD/texgen/) lets you convert any texture pack into a pallete. It will read all the textures in the game, and modify them to use the pallete you input.

### Quikbild
[MisterE's](https://content.minetest.net/users/MisterE/) [Quikbild](https://content.minetest.net/packages/MisterE/quikbild/) minigame has been updated to support gameplay in several languages, concurrently. Now you can have fun in your own language (if it's English, Italian, Spanish, French, or German), or practice and challenge yourself in another language. 

### Spiradilus release
[Spiradilus](https://content.minetest.net/packages/ElCeejo/spiradilus/), featured in March's post, was released on Content Database.
