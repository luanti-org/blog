## Graphics and Performance

### Post-processing: Bloom and Dynamic Exposure

Minetest now has a post-processing pipeline, with support for Bloom and
Dynamic Exposure. This pipeline will allow for new effects to be implemented in the
future, such as depth-of-field and volumetric lighting (god rays).
Post-processing also improves the performance of tone mapping and allows for
settings like saturation adjustment.

Mods and games have control over whether these effects can be enabled on the
client. Part of Minetest's design philosophy is to give more control to game
creators, this includes giving games more control over graphics.

Dynamic Exposure is a feature that simulates eyes adjusting when going from a
well-lit area into a cave, allowing for high dynamic range (HDR).

### Improved Performance: 1000+ View Range on Modern Gaming Hardware

Minetest is well-known for supporting old hardware, but has often not made the
best use of modern and high-end hardware. In 5.7.0, Minetest makes better use of
the GPU when uploading world data. This results in vastly improved performance
on modern gaming hardware at 1000+ view ranges.

Performance improvements aren't just limited to modern gaming hardware. The
occlusion culler has been improved, which provides better performance by not
rendering areas that cannot be seen. The culler is faster, too.

In order to display the world, the client needs to turn blocks into 3d geometry
called meshes. The mesh generaor is now multithreaded, which will improve
performance especially at large view ranges.

## Rotating Entity Selection/Hit Boxes

There's now support for rotating selection and hit boxes.
which will allow mobs and players to have more accurate hitboxes.
This will make combat much nicer, especially with larger monsters.
Unfortunately, this is just for selection/hit boxes, it doesn't change
collision.

## Android Fixed Crosshair

Crosshair support for android has been merged. Unlike desktop, Android defaults
to punching/placing/digging where you tap. With this new feature, users can
enable the crosshair to have an experience closer to desktop.

## ...and more

Mods can now find out the player's window size, which will allow for full-screen and more responsive GUIs
