This release is a little smaller than usual due to the previously-mentioned schedule shift, but 5.13.0 still has quite a few new things for developers to play with, as well as plenty of bug fixes.

You can download Luanti from [our website](https://www.luanti.org/downloads/), check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/), or read the [full changelog](https://docs.luanti.org/about/changelog/#5120--5130).

## Persistent Object IDs

Let's start with the big one: Object IDs! Why is this important? You see, before persistent object IDs, developers had to track unloaded entities and objects manually using staticdata or other gross tricks. With [#14135](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/14135), the engine provides `Object:get_guid()`, returning a globally unique identifier that will remain consistent across unloads and world sessions until the entity is destroyed. Never lose track of your objects ever again!

## Working with Nodes

Here's a handful of methods you can use when working with nodes and chunks.

* `core.get_node_raw()` to query nodes from the map, but faster, and with a content ID ([#16265](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/16265))
* `VoxelManip:initialize()` to create an empty VM storage object ([aa1bab2](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/commit/aa1bab21564cdac01ed2eaed6c2284fc1497626a))
* `core.get_mapgen_chunksize()` to determine the configured chunksize for your custom mapgens ([#16289](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/16289))

Handy, no?

## Show Them Their Inventory

It might not seem significant, but manually pulling up a player's inventory has been a long-requested feature. Now, by passing an empty string (`""`, reserved for the player inventory) as the formname to `core.show_formspec()`, you can open the player's inventory without their input ([#15963](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15963)). The inventory formspec is smoother when updating after input so mods can create forms that update with less flow interruption. I bet this could be used in some creative ways...

## A Couple of Controls

Firstly, you can now cycle through inventory tabs using `ctrl+tab` (`+shift` to cycle in reverse). This is a standard keybind for application tab switching, so we are happy to see it arrive in Luanti ([#16167](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/16167)).

Secondly, the keybind modifier for exiting to the main menu is configurable ([#16250](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/16250)). `ESC` plus whatever you desire. More importantly, it is no longer set by default, preventing players from accidentally leaving the game due to pressing `Shift+ESC` during quick movements. Now you can play CTF in (relative) peace.

## Bugs-B-Gone

The ~~exterminators~~ developers have been hard at work making Luanti more stable and consistent. You may be happy to learn that a plethora of issues have been resolved regarding:

* 9-slice image button rendering ([#16146](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/16146))
* Animated world-aligned texture rendering ([#16091](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/16091))
* Broken keybinds ([#16049](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/16049))
* Lagging bone attachments and animation blending ([#14722](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15722))
* Menu freezing on world join ([#16303](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/16303))
* `[verticalframe` transparency ([158bfa6](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/commit/158bfa6442b00b791161291aa8d36c6a6746d4a6))
* Particlespawner crashes ([#16351](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/16351))

## What's Next?

Back to the 3-month intervals. By the time 5.14.0 lands, you might see [camera color effects](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/16260), [matrix and rotation APIs](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/16212), [glTF morph animations](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/16096), [animated inventory images](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15979), and [more](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/milestone/30)!
