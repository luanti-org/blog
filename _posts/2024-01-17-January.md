## Engine News

### New core dev: Lars M.

The community welcomes Lars M. (aka Luatic, appguru(eu), LMD) ([Github](https://github.com/appgurueu), 
[ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/users/LMD/)), a longtime community member, as the newest Core Dev. 
He is active in the effort to modernize Minetest's mesh loader with the GLTF
format and has a PR to limit the observers of objects, allowing entities to be
hidden from players.

### Gamepad support and dynamic touchscreen support

Progress is being made towards moving to SDL2 input support, which will allow
Minetest to be controlled with a gamepad, mouse and keyboard, or a touchscreen
on any platform. Gamepad support, and Android support of mouse and keyboard
input, have been two major complaints over the years.

Additionally, work is being done to make it possible to switch between
touchscreen and mouse modes at runtime, which will allow laptops with touch
screens or Android devices to switch between modes while playing.

See: [PR #14075](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/14075) and [PR #14146](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/14146)

### Code-defined Entity Animation Improvements

Lars [contributed new features](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/12388) to entity model bone overrides, which allow
setting model bones' position, rotation, and scale in a relative and/or
interpolated manner. This finally allows smooth code-defined animations.

### Godrays Shaders

x2048's godrays shader implementation was adopted by lhofhansl and was merged
into Minetest 5.9-dev. Game developers will have to implement the [new lighting
API features](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/40bf88ac7483084c3ba9b77004c36c6f62ed05ca/doc/lua_api.md?plain=1#L8086) for godrays to be enabled, and players will have to enable bloom
and volumetric light in their settings.

### Customizable Android tool input

There are many items that are used by holding the right mouse button, such as
bows and shields from MineClone2. Until now, these items didn't work on
touchscreens. The recently merged [PR #14087](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/14087) by grorp allows game and mod makers
to fix this. Also, With grorp's PR, Touchscreen players can now punch other
players or entities with a short tap instead of a long tap, which improves the
combat experience and brings Minetest closer to other voxel games on Android.

## Games News

### 2023 Game Jam Winners

The 2023 Game Jam was held in December. The theme was "Unexpected". Contestants
had three weeks to make a game from scratch and submit it to Content Database.
Then the community ranked their favorites on the new [Game Jam
Site](jam.minetest.net). Here are your picks:

### 1st Place
### Citadel by Irevol

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2024_TopOfYear/Citadel.png" caption='The Ruins of the Citadel' %}

Weave through the past and future in the 4-dimensional parkour puzzle game of
[Citadel](https://content.minetest.net/packages/_Irevol_/citadel/) by [Irevol](https://content.minetest.net/users/_Irevol_/). You are a daring explorer who searches the ruins of an
ancient citadel. You find mysterious runes which allow you to navigate the ages.
Use your powers to navigate space and time and unearth the secrets and treasures
of the Citadel.


### 2nd Place
### The Velvet Crystal by Regulus

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2024_TopOfYear/velvet_crystal.png" caption='The mission begins.' %}

Recover the lost crystal and bring the light back into the world in [The Velvet
Crystal](https://content.minetest.net/packages/regulus/regulus_mtgamejam_2023/) by [Regulus](https://content.minetest.net/users/regulus/), a Parkour game with a twist. Use a wand to do stunts and to
help you navigate the castle. Defeat the boss at the end to restore the light.

### 3rd place
### The Unexpected Gambit by NO11

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2024_TopOfYear/gambit.png" caption='Your Move.' %}

Are you a chess Master? [The Unexpected Gambit](https://content.minetest.net/packages/NO11/the_unexpected_gambit/) by [NO11](https://content.minetest.net/users/NO11/) will keep you on your toes
with crazy moves that come at unexpected moments. The game is well-polished and
executes the jam theme in an interesting way.


### Honorable Mentions:
Thanks to everyone who participated in the jam and congradulations to the
winners! Here are some other interesting projects that came out of the 2023 Jam.
We hope all the jam games will continue to receive updates and become polished
examples of what Minetest can do while giving players great experiences.

### MineOS

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2024_TopOfYear/mineos.png" caption='It can even run Boom!' %}

[MineOS](https://content.minetest.net/packages/jordan4ibanez/mineos/) by [jordan4ibanez](https://content.minetest.net/users/jordan4ibanez/) is an astonishing demo, for those of us who are familiar
with Minetest's GUI capabilities. It implements a polished graphical operating
system with retro sound effects and animations and includes several windowed
apps to play around with, including a 3d doom-like shooter. It certainly was
unexpected.

### Shadow Forest

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2024_TopOfYear/shadowForest.png" caption='The shadows are coming!' %}

[Shadow Forest](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/shadow_forest/) by [Wuzzy](https://content.minetest.net/users/Wuzzy/) is a polished role-playing game, where you play a wizard
with a light orb companion. It is your job to rid the forest of shadows which
have invaded it. Use your weapons to defeat enemies, but don't become too caught
up in battle and stall your progress through the world.

### Minetest at Events in December

In late 2023, Minetest was featured at several conventions around Italy thanks
to Zughy and his sponsor Italian Linux Society. Zughy has brought Minetest to
several events in Northern and Central Italy from underground videogame
festivals like [Zona Warpa](https://www.zonawarpa.it/) to Free software events like [MERGE-it](https://merge-it.net/). He demoed games
and gave talks (you can listen to one of them [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBZoPYleoX4), in spaghetti language 🍝 ). In
December Zughy also presented a workshop at Empoli for the first time, where
participants learned how to create a complete minigame from scratch using
[arena_lib](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Zughy/arena_lib/). It doesn't seem like these events are going to stop. What's next?
FOSDEM!

## FOSDEM 2024

Minetest will be at FOSDEM 2024. FOSDEM is the largest conference in Europe for
free and open-source software and will be held from 3rd to 4th February in
Brussels, Belgium. We'll be running a booth, showing off Minetest, giving out
stickers and goodies, and introducing visitors to the Minetest!

If you happen to be in the area, come say hi!
