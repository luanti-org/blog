## Engine News

This month, Rubenwardy finally got his minetest.get_player_window_information()
PR merged, allowing mods to poll clients for their window parameters. The new
information will make it possible to design responsive formspecs that fit
properly on each client's screen.

x2048's work on making meshes the size of 8 mapblocks was also merged this
month, allowing for vastly greater view distances. Reducing the number of meshes
drawn reduces the computation necessary to draw the map thereby improving
performance or allowing even greater view distances at the same framerates.

x2048 also merged a feature that allows chat to be disabled on servers, giving
more control to games and mods. Mod authors may wish to take advantage of this
feature to implement their chat system differently than the default.

Minetest has entered a feature freeze in preparation for the 5.7 release. Only bug
fixes will be accepted until the freeze is over. Now is the time to test the
release candidate which can be found here, and submit any bug reports so that
they can be fixed before the release. Server owners are especially encouraged to
test the release candidate to ensure a smooth upgrade.

Additionally, x2048 is continuing graphics improvement work with a PR to add
post-processing-based Antialiasing filters. Also, Desour is working on improving
the performance of shapes craft recipe matching.

Wuzzy has added a large selection of boats to Repixture in the "The Nautical
Update" which includes various types of rafts and log boats. Each style has its
handling mechanics. Additionally, a new type of seaweed lets you collect air to
stay underwater longer. Other water-related and miscellaneous improvements were
also added.
